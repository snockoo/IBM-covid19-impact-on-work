# INSIGHT AND FINDING: 
  Working professionals affected by COVID-19 tended to experience increased work hours more often. This suggests that the pandemic may have led to longer working hours for some individuals, possibly due to factors like remote work adjustments, increased workload, or a blurring of boundaries between personal and professional life. To mitigate this, professionals should prioritize setting clear work-life boundaries, utilize available technology for efficient remote work, and communicate openly with employers about workload concerns.
